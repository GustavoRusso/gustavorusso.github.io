Every developer wishes to build **quality** software. It is frequent to see a developer that is **proud of the code** he has just completed. Although, it is even more frequent to see a developer feeling frustrated after several months of work in the same application, feeling that he could has done **more** or **better**. Bigger is the application, harder is to maintain its quality. The developers are the firsts to know the disappointments of their products. If it would depend on developers, the applications would never be considered completed. There would always be something to add or to improve. The feeling of been releasing an **unfinished** product causes unhappiness for many software developers.

However... **Software is not for its creators, it is for its users**.

Software projects begin from user's needs. The users put in the project their hope for an easier and happier life. At first the illusion is great. As time passes the initial enthusiasm start to vanish. The lack of information about the development progress and the decreasing trust in the final product, make the doubts grow in the users. When it come the promise of the software release, the user's hopes tends to increase, they start to imagine how will be their new life now that the new software is coming.

What will be the user's opinion regarding the product that is about to receive?

It is likely that the user will perceive the same mistakes that the developers regretted in their product and caused that they didn't want to stop the development process.

But users see things in a different way to developers.

The users don't see the **internal quality** of the software. The users notice how the software changes theirs daily work, and their happiness depends on how this change affects them. Only if the change makes them happy, then the development work will be worthwhile.

Developers may not feel happy when they are forced to deliver software without the quality they wished to achieve, but certainly they will start to feel happier if they see that users use their software every day and think that his life is a little easier as a result.
